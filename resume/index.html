					<h4>Release Engineer</h4>
					<p>Release Engineer for retail point-of-sale software written for iOS and java platforms.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="joboverview">
					<h5>Overview</h5>
					<p>Starmount hired me as their configuration management and release engineer. I was initially responsible for overhauling their build environment to better support development efforts, as there was no one dedicated to this prior.</p>
					<p>I was responsible for maintaining Starmount's continuous integration and build infrastructure, ensuring formal release processes across many products and services, maintaining code repositories, and assisting with devops-type issues that arise.</p>
					<p>Starmount was acquired by Infor on August 1, 2016 and my job responsibilities did not change.</p>
					<p>Continuing on where we left off at Starmount, I'm still serving as release engineer at Infor, responsible for maintaining the continuous integration and build infrastructure, maintaining code repositories, and assisting with devops-type issues that arise.<p>
					<p>Current work includes migrating the build infrastructure from on-premise VMs and bare metal machines to AWS, where we'll be able to take advantage of a more fluid build environment. I'm continuing the effort with development teams to implement a continuous delivery system for our cloud-based software.</p>

				<div class="jobsummary">
					<h4>Release Engineer</h4>
					<p>Sole Release Engineer for Collaborative Fusion with the primary responsibility of ensuring all software releases and patches for client systems are versioned and deployed properly. Spent 5 years in a split role as both software engineer and release engineer. In November 2010, shifted full focus to release engineering.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="joboverview">
					<p>I was brought on board in the company's infancy as a software engineer, implementing web-based software designs via html and css on top of a php backend. Shortly after, I took on the role of the company's release engineer in addition to my role as "the css guru". I wrote custom deployment scripts, managed code repositories, and owned the release process by which all of our software was deployed and upgraded.</p>
					<p>At Collaborative Fusion, we wrote software to aid in emergency response preparedness, primarily through implementing the guidelines of a federal program called ESAR-VHP, or the "Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals". Our customers were state and local governments who used (and continue to use) our software as a registry of health professionals to meet the ESAR-VHP requirements. We integrated with accreditation boards to ensure emergency relief coordinators could verify the identity, licenses, and credentials of volunteers before an emergency happened, saving both time and hopefully lives through rapid deployment.</p>
					<p>For industry professional development to better serve our customers and their users, I completed a series of FEMA's online independent study courses. Through these, I became knowledgable of a variety of topics relating to emergency response management, incident response, disaster relief, and emergency operations.</p>

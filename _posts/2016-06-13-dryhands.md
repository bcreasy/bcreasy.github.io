Last week, I came to the realization that I don't need to use disposable paper towels to dry my hands.

No one does.

For a while now, after seeing [this TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FMBSblpcrc), I'd been using only one small sheet of paper towel to dry my hands in public restrooms.  But here's the thing: I don't even need to use a single sheet to dry my hands after I wash them.  I wash them with soap and water.  I shake them to get a lot of the clean water off.  Then, instead of tearing off a paper towel that will immediately be thrown in the trash, I simply dry my hands on my shirt or pant legs.  The small amount of clean water on my clothing will dry in a minute or two and no unnecessary waste has been created.

This is just one more small step toward reducing my ecological footprint on this world.

Please join me in making this tiny change with a significant impact.

After much internal hemming and hawing today, I decided to update the URL structure of the log posts on this site:  URLs no longer include the publish date.

It's my hope that this will look cleaner, and that it will encourage me to write with mindful attention to the name in the URL.  Having the publish date in the URL was also redundant, as all log posts display the publish date below their respective titles.  [Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com) offers some more [good reasons](http://mattgemmell.com/permalinks/) why this format is superior.

For the time being, a [302 redirect](https://http.cat/302) is in place for links using the old URL format.  After some time, I'll switch to use a [301 redirect](https://http.cat/301).

My apologies for the RSS clutter &mdash; this will hopefully be the last time that happens for a while.

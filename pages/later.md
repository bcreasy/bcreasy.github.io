This is a list of things I intend to do in the future:

- Become financial independent by age 47.
- Podium in a cycling race.
- Ride my bicycle a distance of at least 5000 miles annually.
- Re-learn the Japanese language.
- Travel to Japan and China.
- Read William Gibson's "Bridge Trilogy".
- Figure out what I want to be when I grow up.

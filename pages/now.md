I'm in Austin, Texas, living a simple and quiet life, focusing on these things:

- Caring for Lina.
- Living in the moment, yet planning for the possible.
- Advocating for non-human and human animal rights.
- Reducing my ecological and economical footprints.
- Reducing my personal possessions through selling and donating.
- Base miles and general fitness building in preparation for the 2017 race season.
- Reducing my body weight to 147 pounds.
- Learning about various personal finance topics.
- Aiming for a 65% average savings rate and maintaining at least 50%.
- Reading "Burning Chrome" anthology.

Here is how I intend to spend my time and energy [/later]({{ root_url }}/later).
